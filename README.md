Real Estate Portal - WordPress Performance & SEO Case Study
This repository represents the case study for a complex real estate portal I developed and optimized using the Houzez theme on WordPress. The live site can be viewed at: https://imoveis.portalimovelja.com.br/

The Challenge:
To build a feature-rich portal with over 15 plugins that could handle thousands of listings while achieving elite performance scores on Google PageSpeed Insights, a task many consider impossible with heavy themes like Houzez.

The Solution & Key Achievements:
My approach was not about adding more code, but about intelligent optimization. The core of the success came from a deep and meticulous configuration of the existing technology stack.
Advanced LiteSpeed Cache Configuration: I fine-tuned over 100 settings within the LiteSpeed Cache plugin (v7.3.0.1), focusing on optimal caching policies, database optimization, and precise asset delivery rules to eliminate render-blocking resources.

Surgical Code Injection: While 95% of the optimization was through expert-level configuration, I identified one critical bottleneck that plugins couldn't solve: the mobile logo was not being prioritized. I wrote a single, lightweight JavaScript snippet to fix this.
